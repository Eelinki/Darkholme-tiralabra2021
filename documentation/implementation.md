# Implementation

## Data structures

The final generated dungeon is saved into a two-dimensional array (int[][]).

## Performance

The time complexity of the Delaunay triangulation (Bowyer-Watson) is O(n<sup>2</sup>).

## Input data

User can specify:
- The amount of points
- The size of the map
- Percentage of edges from the Delaynay graph used to create corridors
- The seed used for the generation process.
