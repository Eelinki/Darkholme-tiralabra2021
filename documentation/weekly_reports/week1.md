# Week 1 report

Hours used: 4

### First week progress

This week I decided the project topic what I want to work on. As a passionate gamer, I wanted to make create my own dungeon generator.

The aim is to be able to input the amount of rooms, and the application will generate a dungeon, essentially a map with rooms and corridors.

I also created the project repository and a Gradle project, but most of the hours used this week went into research.

### First week challenges

There are a ton of ways to generate maps like these, but choosing the algorithms proved to be more difficult than what I initially expected. There is also the challenge that the algorithms have be difficult enough to implement for the course.

I am also unsure about the data structures I will have to implement.

### Next week goals

My goal for the next week is to decide the algorithms and generation process, and get started with the actual programming of the project.
