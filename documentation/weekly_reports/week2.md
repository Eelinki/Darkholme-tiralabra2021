# Week 2 report

Hours used: 8

### Second week progress

This week I created the foundation for the application, and implemented the first step of the dungeon generation process.

I also decided the algorithms and methods I will be using.

Implemented some unit testing.

### Second week challenges

Creating comprehensive unit testing for application like this is difficult.

### Next week goals

My goal for the next week is to finish the graph generation, including Delaunay triangulation and finding the minimum spanning tree.
