# Week 3 report

Hours used: 8

### Third week progress

This week I implemented the Bowyer-Watson algorithm for Delaynau triangulation. I still have to add the feature to remove each triangle that contains a vertex from the original super triangle(s).

I also began to work on testing and implementation documentation.

### Third week challenges

Creating the triangulation algorithm proved to be quite a difficult task.

### Next week goals

Finish algorithms and map generation, start working on custom data-types.

Implement more unit testing.
