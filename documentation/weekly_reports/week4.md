# Week 4 report

Hours used: 8

### Fourth week progress

This week I finished the Bowyer-Watson algorithm. I also cleaned up the project code, added checkstyle, codecov and CI using GitHub actions.

### Fourth week challenges

I've had some personal/motivational issues last few weeks, noticeably slowing down progress. Due to this, I still could not finish the generation process this week.

### Next week goals

Finally finish the map generation process, hopefully implement all custom data-types.

Focus on testing and documentation.
